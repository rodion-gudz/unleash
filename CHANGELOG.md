# Changelog

## [2.1.0] — 2026-09-22 (fork)

Fork of mateussiqueira/unleash. Fixes on top of upstream v2.0.0:

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `resolve_data_volume` leaked log output into the captured
  variable (`data_mount=$(...)`), so every Recovery command (bypass,
  suppress, heal, persist, firewall, backup) wrote to junk directories
  instead of the target Data volume and reported fake success.
  All logging now goes to stderr. (Upstream issue #23)
- `predict`: broken heredoc (`ORGS)`) made the command unusable.
- `SCRIPT_DIR` / `LIB_DIR` unbound-variable crashes in standalone builds
  (heal, monitor, doctor) — now guarded with `${VAR:-}`.
- self-update: downloads `unleash-standalone.sh` (previously it replaced a
  standalone install with the modular entry script, which then failed with
  "Library not found"); repo now points to this fork.

### Changed
- Blocklist reduced to MDM enrollment endpoints only:
  deviceenrollment / mdmenrollment / iprofiles / acmdm / axm-adm-mdm /
  axm-adm-enroll. `gdmf.apple.com`, `gs.apple.com`, `albert.apple.com`,
  `configuration/xp/tb/vpp.itunes` are no longer blocked — they break
  software updates, App Store and activation.
- `/etc/hosts` is locked with `chflags uchg` after blocking (unlocked
  before edits). Manual unlock: `sudo chflags nouchg /etc/hosts`.
- `examples/build-standalone.sh` now bundles all libs (init, suggest,
  remediate, telemetry, predict, discord were missing).
